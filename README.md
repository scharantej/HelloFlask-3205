## Flask Application Design for "Hello World" Problem

### HTML Files

- **home.html**: This is the main page of the application that will display the "Hello, World!" message. It includes basic HTML structure and a placeholder for the message to be displayed.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <title>Hello World</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

### Routes

- **@app.route('/'):** This route is bound to the home page of the application. When a user visits the root URL of the application (e.g., http://localhost:5000/), this route will be triggered and display the "home.html" page.

```python
@app.route('/')
def home():
  return render_template('home.html')
```
